# Arch Linux Scripts
This are my Arch Linux configuration scripts.

## How to run?
Type `./` followed by the script name:
```bash
./script.sh
```
## Scripts
`emoji.sh` gives you emoji support, Arch doesn't have emoji by default.

`maintenance.sh` allows you to do common maintenance tasks in your system.

`control_volume.sh` you can bind this script to a key and control the volume through the keyboard, useful for window managers.

`plasma_theme_switcher.sh` is a automatic theme switcher for the Plasma desktop, run this periodically in your system to update your theme depending on the time of day.

`programs.sh` is a script to install all of the programs I need in a new Arch Installation.
